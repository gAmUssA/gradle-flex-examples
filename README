Examples demonstrating how to use Gradle to build Flex applications.

The HelloWorld directory shows a simple 'Hello World' Flex 4 application that builds with Gradle (currently Gradle 1.0 Milestone 3).

* Git Submodules *

This project uses a Git submodule to include the Gradle Flex plugin as a buildSrc directory (have a look at Gradle's documentation on writing plugins for more info).

You need to run some additional Git commands to get the submodules setup correctly (these must be run in the top-level directory of the Git project):

git submodule init
git submodule update

* Pre-requisites *

You need to create a FLEX_HOME environment variable pointing at the root directory of a Flex 4.1 SDK.

* Caveats *

I've only tested this on the Windows platform and this is very much a work-in-progress.
