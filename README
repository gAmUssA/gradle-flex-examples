Examples demonstrating how to use Gradle to build Flex applications.

The HelloWorld directory shows a simple 'Hello World' Flex 4 application that builds with Gradle (currently Gradle 1.0 Milestone 3).

This project uses a Git submodule to include the Gradle Flex plugin as a buildSrc directory (have a look at Gradle's documentation on writing plugins for more info).

* Pre-requisites *

You need to create a FLEX_HOME environment variable pointing at the root directory of a Flex 4.1 SDK.

* Caveats *

I've only tested this on the Windows platform and this is very much a work-in-progress.
